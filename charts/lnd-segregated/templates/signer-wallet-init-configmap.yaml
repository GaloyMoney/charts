    # This Expect script was generated by autoexpect on Thu Oct 20 10:50:00 2022
    # Expect and autoexpect were both written by Don Libes, NIST.
    #
    # Note that autoexpect does not guarantee a working script.  It
    # necessarily has to guess about certain things.  Two reasons a script
    # might fail are:
    #
    # 1) timing - A surprising number of programs (rn, ksh, zsh, telnet,
    # etc.) and devices discard or ignore keystrokes that arrive "too
    # quickly" after prompts.  If you find your new script hanging up at
    # one spot, try adding a short sleep just before the previous send.
    # Setting "force_conservative" to 1 (see below) makes Expect do this
    # automatically - pausing briefly before sending each character.  This
    # pacifies every program I know of.  The -c flag makes the script do
    # this in the first place.  The -C flag allows you to define a
    # character to toggle this mode off and on.

    set force_conservative 0  ;# set to 1 to force conservative mode even if
                              ;# script wasn't run conservatively originally
    if {$force_conservative} {
            set send_slow {1 .1}
            proc send {ignore arg} {
                    sleep .1
                    exp_send -s -- $arg
            }
    }

    #
    # 2) differing output - Some programs produce different output each time
    # they run.  The "date" command is an obvious example.  Another is
    # ftp, if it produces throughput statistics at the end of a file
    # transfer.  If this causes a problem, delete these patterns or replace
    # them with wildcards.  An alternative is to use the -p flag (for
    # "prompt") which makes Expect only look for the last line of output
    # (i.e., the prompt).  The -P flag allows you to define a character to
    # toggle this mode off and on.
